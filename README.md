LinkTagger
==========

This is an example project which demonstrates how to create custom hyper links in the Visual Studio editor.  

When installed this extension will recognize any text in the form "github:username" as a link.  For example

    github:jaredpar

This will be rendered as a normal hyper link in the editor.  If the link is clicked on while holding the left control key the web browser will open to the users github page
